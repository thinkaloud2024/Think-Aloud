So easy to forget
So easy to ignore
People never remember it
Until they lose it
Then they claw for it
Anywhere they can

High up the sky
People seem to care
Saving every bit of oxygen
It could be life or death
But they so easily forget
While on the ground

The air wants to be noticed
Taking the form of the wind
Blowing off people’s hats
Sending papers flying into the sky
Playing with children 
By picking up their kites

Air aids the fire in its raids
It is simply revenge
Against the ungrateful humans
It is righteous in its mission
Who would want appreciation
Only with their absence?
