Fame is a rain cloud parting blue
Soon blended with the sun orange
Never outlasting the misty gray time
It is like a snowflake
So magnificent when it falls from the sky
So overlooked when it melts
On the ground with thousands of others

Enmity is like a flower
It blossoms in the soil of past grudges
Yet when the flood of time comes
It is washed away
The soil that once fed it
Gone with the water
As though it never existed
