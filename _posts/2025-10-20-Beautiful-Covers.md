Nothing should be judged
By any type of cover
Plain, shiny, or transparent
Don’t sit on random bed covers
There might be a needle
Hiding underneath the fluffy layers

Don’t trust boxes
Simply because of a cover
It might have been removed
All the blackberries in the box
Have already been stolen

Don’t be intrigued
While on a whirring airplane
And seeing something 
Covered by a fluffy cloud
There might be nothing underneath
Besides the vast ocean

Don’t lean on random walls
That cover things behind
They might have cracked
Eons ago
And they will break
Revealing the cliff behind
