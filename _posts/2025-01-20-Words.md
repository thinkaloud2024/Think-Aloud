Words we say ride on clouds
So fast that four horses cannot catch them
Our voices carry these words
And they soar in the sky
Out of control
The second they escape

They can whir like flies
Around people’s faces
And in people’s ears
Or stab like needles

They push people
Over cliffs and into valleys
Of pitch-black darkness
Sometimes people can’t escape
From the power of words
Even with four horses
