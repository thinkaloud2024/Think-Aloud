I remember embarrassing failures
Dazzling, shocking successes 
But I forget anything in between
The plain followers of pattern
Things made as if from a mold
The mold of my life

When I fail my cheeks turn red
The temperature rises
The heat forever a part of me
Any trigger brings it back
To my mind, my thoughts
And I feel it all over again

When I succeed I am a spark
Against the dull, dark background
My soul floats, drifting high
I try to relive it
In anyway I can
Finding the triggers anywhere

Things that are in between
The middle of a school year
A Wednesday of a tiring week
Colors of an average shade
Things that are not successes not failures
Never appear again in my mind
