The lotus candle-holder
Is a shade 
Of misty gray
The color of mystery
And unexpectedness 
With 15 petals
That contradict each other
Through different sizes
Aspects of the same object

Smooth and round on one side
With brown highlights on the petals
The other side is coarse
And a shade of fiery red
It is unpredictable
What side the lotus might show
When it is flipped in the air
It can be perfect like a sphere
While also having the potential
To be a bumpy road
Of imperfection

The lotus that rests in a placid pond
Also sails with the wind
When a storm arrives
Lotuses can be found 
With various colors
That overlap each other
When traveling up the petal

This lotus however
Is unique
It is this specific shade of gray
That symbolizes such mystery
